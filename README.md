SPEED STARS BY KADIN WELDON AND SHERYAN LANKAPALI

This game is basicallyy a game where you are a single player and you pick which event you want to run aka 100,200,300,400 etc and the goal is to click as fast as you can im thinking of adding a rythm to it but there will be a timer and when you cross the finish line the timer stops and your time you get is saved your goal is to beat your best time in each race so this is a track and field game
